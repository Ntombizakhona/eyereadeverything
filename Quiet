Quiet: 
The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking
by
Susan Cain
  
Too often, I am told to: “Speak More.”
But, who will listen, if we're all speaking?
I am often tempted to respond with, “Shut Up More.”

This is a good book that will help you appreciate your introversion, and appreciate introverts.

It encourages individualism and the benefits of solitude & introversion in a world where it is often encouraged to be wild and about with a bunch of people.

It is great for the employers, employees, parents and partners of quiet and introverted people, who wish to understand them and their unique, creative thought processes, that require silence and introversion.
