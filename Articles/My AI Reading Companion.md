My AI Reading Companion
=======================

How I Built the EyeReadEverything App on PartyRock (and How You Can Remix It!)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You know when you finish a great book or an absolutely meh one that you low-key wanted to hurl against the wall and you _so_ wish you had someone to talk to about it?

Someone who gets it.

Someone who can recommend what to read next.

And maybe even show you a cool new cover design…

Well, that’s exactly why I built [_EyeReadEverything_](https://partyrock.aws/u/ntombizakhona/8iZ0zj0Mt/EyeReadEverything), my AI Book Reviewer App!

And the best part? I built it with **PartyRock**, a no-code playground that lets anyone experiment with AI like a pro.

What Is PartyRock?
------------------

PartyRock is literally the _easiest_ way to build AI apps:

No coding.

No setup.

No stress!

Just stack a few visual blocks, give the AI some instructions, and watch the magic happen.

You can:

🔧 Mix and match components for text, images, and chat

✏️ Write simple prompts instead of scripts

⚡ See instant results and tweak as you go

🔁 Remix anyone’s app (including mine, especially mine!) and make it your own.

_If you’ve ever wanted to “_**_play_**_” with AI, PartyRock is your creative sandbox._

💡 Why You Should Remix My App
------------------------------

This app isn’t just mine, it’s ours. PartyRock makes sharing and remixing dead simple.

When you remix an app in PartyRock, you’re not just copying it, you’re personalizing it. Maybe you want an app that focuses on:

✨ Fantasy or sci-fi recommendations only

👶 Kid-friendly or YA book reviews

🎧 Audiobook comparisons

📚 Genre-specific reading challenges

📒 Academic-style literary analysis

Whatever your reading passion is, you can adapt EyeReadEverything to fit your vision.

Once you remix it, share your version, I’d love to see what you come up with! Try new prompts, adjust the output style, or even add your own creative sections.

I’d love to see your versions! Seriously, clone it, put your spin on it, and drop your remix link.

🛠️ A Few Quick Tips
--------------------

1.  Get one feature perfect before moving on.
2.  Ask the AI for structured outputs.
3.  Use consistent prompts to keep the tone balanced.
4.  Have fun experimenting. You’ll learn a ton fast.
