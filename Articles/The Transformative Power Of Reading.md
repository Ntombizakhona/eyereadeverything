The Transformative Power of Reading
===================================

A Journey from Kindergarten Rebel to Lifelong Learner
-----------------------------------------------------

### _Why This Message Bears Repeating (Again and Again)_

I’m definitely _that_ person who won’t stop talking about reading. I’ve written about it before, multiple times, actually, scattered across various blogs that now live in the forgotten corners of the internet.

Yet here I am again, ready to make the case one more time. Why? Because some truths are worth repeating, especially when society seems to be sprinting in the opposite direction.

I know what you’re thinking: _“Another article about reading? There must be a gazillion of these.”_

You’re absolutely right. The internet is saturated with listicles promising to reveal **10 Amazing Benefits of Reading or Why Successful People Read 50 Books a Year.** But hear me out, I want to add these articles, it’s not saturated enough. *_ha ha*_

So anyways, recently, while diving through my digital archives (thank you, iCloud and GitHub, for being the librarians of my past), I stumbled upon an article I wrote in the 2010s. Reading it felt like finding a letter from my younger self: raw, passionate, and surprisingly relevant. I’ve taken that piece, refined it, modernized it, and repolished it for today’s world.

**And I’ll tell you something else**: I’ll probably write about this again in the 2030s. Not because I’m running out of ideas, but because the fundamental power of reading transcends decades, technologies, and trends.

The medium may evolve from papyrus to paper to pixels but the magic of absorbing knowledge through written words remains humanity’s most democratic superpower!

This isn’t just another article. It’s a personal story, a confession, and an invitation to rediscover something profound that our fast-paced, notification-driven world is slowly stealing from us: the ability to think deeply, feel completely, and understand broadly.

So settle in. **Silence your phone.** _And let me tell you how a quiet five-year-old’s obsession with reading transformed not just her academic trajectory, but her entire way of experiencing life…_

### The Original Article

A Kindergartner’s Quest for Power
---------------------------------

**Go Read!**

_When Being Different Meant Being Hungry for Knowledge_

**At the tender age of five, when I started school, I stood out.**

I stood out from my peers because I didn’t fit in. I didn’t fit in because my teachers thought I didn’t fit in, a self-fulfilling prophecy that labels so often become in educational settings.

I am definitely not a talkative individual.

Never have been. Don’t intend to be.

I was surrounded by the forever-chattering toddlers and kindergartners who seemed perpetually excited about the exact same things every single day, my silence became suspicious. My teachers, well-meaning but confused by my quietness, began whispering their concerns…

They weren’t being malicious; they simply couldn’t understand a child who wasn’t enthralled by the standard curriculum of childhood.

My fellow peers were always excited about the standard kindergarten curriculum, crèche stuff you know: coloring in pictures,

playing with blocks,

eating snacks,

singing annoying nursery rhymes, and this is important, being read stories **TO**.

_Passive consumption_.

Someone else’s voice bringing words to life while we sat cross-legged on a carpet, heads tilted up in mandatory attention.

I particularly wasn’t excited because it was so monotonous, so mind-numbingly repetitive. Each time I woke up from bed, I’d think with dread: “Ah, I’m going back to Happy Children Pre Primary School to jump around and sing those same songs all over again!”

_I hated it_.

**But I had to go.**

Children don’t get to opt out of their education, even when that education feels like daily imprisonment.

### Why Did I Hate All Of That?

The answer is simple, though it took me years to articulate it properly: I felt like our teachers were not making us read for ourselves. They were gatekeepers, standing between us and the actual power. They would read TO us, but not teach us to read FOR ourselves.

And in my five-year-old mind, I had developed a theory, admittedly childish and scientifically inaccurate, but psychologically powerful enough to fuel my obsession.

_I thought the ability to read, and the more you read, was what would make you physically grow and become powerful._

### The Flawed But Brilliant Logic of a Child

My evidence was observational and, to my young mind, conclusive:

In my five-year-old mind, I had developed a theory, admittedly flawed, but profoundly motivating. I observed my teachers constantly absorbed in magazines during breaks.

At home, my older siblings would occasionally immerse themselves in books, but most significantly, my father seemed perpetually attached to some form of reading material, whether it was the newspaper, a novel, or work documents.

**And they were all bigger and taller than me!**

Hence, my mentality: _Reading + Writing = Growth._

Physical, tangible growth.

In my infantile logic, I genuinely believed I would remain an annoying little toddler forever because of my inability to read independently.

The adults around me possessed this magical skill, and it clearly made them larger, more powerful, more capable of navigating the world. I was locked out of this power by my illiteracy, and that made me resent my educators even more.

**I wanted to read.**

Nothing was fun about coloring pictures, singing and dancing, and playing with toys. These felt like distractions, like busy work designed to keep us docile and small.

### The Breakthrough

Faking It Until I Could Make It
-------------------------------

Frustrated and determined, I devised a plan. I started pretending as though I was reading: grabbing books, opening them to random pages, and always muttering some complete rubbish while moving my finger across the incomprehensible symbols. It was my silent protest, my declaration that I was ready for more.

One of my teachers noticed.

Instead of dismissing my charade, she saw the hunger beneath the performance. While the other kids were coloring or playing, she started pulling me aside and teaching me to read, really, actually read.

**It was hard**.

But, “Everything is hard at first.” Like Musashi Miyamoto would say. Distinguishing “s” from “z,” understanding that certain letters made specific sounds, grasping that these sounds combined to form words that carried meaning, it was like learning an alien language. But trying to crack this code thrilled me to my core. Each small victory felt like unlocking a new level of existence.

Eventually, I learned. And I became more and more excited, believing that I would finally grow and become powerful. And in the years that followed, I always had a book.

Always.

Reading became not just a hobby, but an identity. Reading is fun! (Though five-year-old me would have said: Reading is POWER!)

### The Beautiful Irony

Wrong Motivation, Right Outcome
-------------------------------

Here’s the thing I can admit now, decades later: _my mindset that inspired me to read was completely erroneous in terms of the type of growth I thought would be facilitated_.

Reading didn’t make me taller.

It didn’t give me muscles.

It didn’t make me physically powerful in the way I imagined.

But it did make me grow.

Your imagination grows.

Your varied thought capabilities grow.

Your understanding of human nature, history, science, emotion, and possibility grows.

Not your height or body, but something infinitely more valuable: **your mind.**

_I was wrong about the mechanism but completely right about the transformation._

### The Practical Magic

How Reading Changes Everything
------------------------------

Reading may seem boring and monotonous to those who haven’t discovered the right book yet, but it is very helpful indeed!

Let me be specific about what cultivating a reading habit at a young age actually does for you:

**It will be the difference between studying 2 hours before an exam and studying 10 minutes before an exam:** When you read widely and consistently, you’re constantly building background knowledge. Studying becomes less about cramming foreign information and more about reviewing concepts you’ve already encountered in different contexts. Your brain creates connections automatically. Learning becomes pattern recognition rather than memorization.

**It will be the difference between grasping a new concept the moment it’s taught versus grasping it only after it’s been repeated various times:** Readers develop what I call “_conceptual agility_”, the ability to understand new ideas quickly because they’ve trained their brains to process and integrate information efficiently. You’ve seen similar ideas before. Your mental filing system is robust and well-organized.

**It will be the difference between attending 30 percent of classes and achieving an average of 70% versus attending 70 percent of classes and barely scraping 30%:** This isn’t an endorsement of skipping class, but rather recognition of a truth: readers become independent learners. You develop the ability to extract knowledge from text without requiring an intermediary to explain it to you. You become self-sufficient in your education.

**It will be the difference between talking when you have something to say versus having something to say because you’re expected to talk:** Readers accumulate ideas, perspectives, insights, and wisdom. When you speak, you draw from a deep well of knowledge. Your contributions become substantive. You don’t fill silence with noise, you add value to conversations.

### A Plea to Parents and Educators

Reading is something that I wish more parents would actively instill in their children. Not as a punishment or academic obligation, but as an adventure, as discovery, as power.

Take them to the library every once in a while. Make it a ritual, a special outing. Don’t only go the day before an assignment is due, rushing through the aisles in stressed desperation. That teaches children to associate reading with anxiety and obligation.

If you only drag kids to libraries under academic pressure, they’ll never enjoy the orgasmic pleasures of stimulating their mind and imagination through reading.

Yes, I said orgasmic – because that’s what it feels like when you’re completely absorbed in a brilliant book. Time disappears. You exist in two worlds simultaneously. Your neurons fire in patterns of pure pleasure.

Nothing beats an amazing afternoon where you relax by reading a captivating book while drinking an awesome cup of Green tea (or Rooibos, or coffee, or hot chocolate – whatever brings you comfort).

If you’re a techno geek like this current generation, the barrier to entry has never been lower. There are countless e-books online, audiobooks, apps, free libraries, subscription services. The excuse “_I don’t have access to books”_ is increasingly obsolete.

### The Ultimate Promise

Preparedness for Everything
---------------------------

Read.

_Read._

**Read**.

You’ll be amazed at how much nothing will surprise you in this world. Nothing at all.

This isn’t cynicism,it’s radical preparedness. When you’ve read widely across history, psychology, philosophy, science, and fiction, you begin to recognize patterns. Human nature remains consistent. The challenges we face echo challenges faced before. The solutions we seek have been attempted, documented, analyzed.

You won’t become jaded, you’ll become wise. You’ll navigate complexity with the accumulated wisdom of thousands of thinkers, writers, and storytellers who came before you.

Make reading your new hobby. No more #PhuzaThursday (party Thursday), welcome to #FundaFriday (read Friday)! Transform your relationship with knowledge and watch every other aspect of your life improve in ways you never anticipated.

### Benefits of Reading In The 2020s

Why This Decade Demands Readers More Than Ever
----------------------------------------------

While the timeless benefits of reading remain unchanged, our current era has revealed urgent new reasons to cultivate a serious reading habit. Here’s why reading isn’t just beneficial in the 2020s, it’s essential for survival and success:

### 1. Rebuilding Attention in the Age of Distraction

Let’s confront an uncomfortable truth: our attention spans are _collapsing_. Research indicates the average human attention span has dropped to approximately 8 seconds, technically shorter than a goldfish. We’ve been conditioned by social media algorithms designed for addiction, by notification systems engineered to interrupt, by content platforms optimized for endless scrolling rather than deep engagement.

_Reading, especially long-form reading, is one of the few activities that actively rebuilds our capacity for sustained focus and deep concentration._

It’s mental resistance training in an age of distraction. When you sit with a book for 30 minutes, an hour, or longer, you’re literally rewiring your brain’s ability to stay with complexity, to resist the dopamine hits of constant novelty, to find satisfaction in gradual revelation rather than instant gratification.

Think of reading as the gym membership for your attention span. Every page you complete is a rep.

Every chapter you finish is a set.

Over time, you build cognitive endurance that transfers to every other area of life… work projects, relationships, problem-solving, strategic thinking.

### 2. Developing Critical Thinking in the Misinformation Era

We’re living through an information crisis.

Not a shortage of information, the opposite.

We’re drowning in data but starving for truth.

Fake news spreads six times faster than accurate information on social media.

Conspiracy theories flourish.

Manipulated narratives go viral.

Deepfakes blur reality. Echo chambers reinforce biases.

_Well-read individuals develop sophisticated bullshit detectors._

When you’ve read widely across different perspectives, time periods, disciplines, and ideologies you develop an internal compass for truth. You recognize logical fallacies. You spot emotional manipulation. You notice when arguments lack substance beneath their confident presentation.

Reading diverse sources, engaging with complex arguments that challenge your worldview, and exposing yourself to various perspectives creates what I call “_mental antibodies_” against manipulation and propaganda. You become harder to fool, harder to radicalize, harder to manipulate because you’ve encountered these patterns before in your reading.

In an era where information warfare is real, critical thinking isn’t optional. It’s survival. And reading is how you build that immunity.

### 3. Cultivating Empathy and Emotional Intelligence

Here’s something fascinating that research consistently demonstrates: _reading fiction particularly literary fiction significantly increases empathy and emotional intelligence._ Studies using fMRI scans show that when we read about characters experiencing emotions, the same neural regions activate as when we experience those emotions ourselves.

By inhabiting different characters’ perspectives, living through their struggles, experiencing their inner lives, we literally expand our capacity to understand others. We practice being someone else. We feel what it’s like to live in a different body, a different time period, a different set of circumstances.

In our increasingly polarized world, where people retreat into ideological tribes and demonize those who think differently, this might be reading’s most socially valuable benefit. Fiction teaches us that people we disagree with are still fully human, complex, contradictory, and worthy of understanding.

You can’t hate someone whose inner life you’ve truly understood. Reading builds bridges in a world obsessed with building walls.

### 4. Career Advancement and Professional Relevance

Let’s talk money and success, because sometimes practical motivation works when idealistic motivation doesn’t.

_Leaders are readers._

This isn’t a cliché, it’s a documented pattern. Warren Buffett spends approximately 80% of his workday reading. Bill Gates reads about 50 books per year and credits much of his success to continuous learning. Elon Musk taught himself rocket science through books when experts told him it was impossible.

The pattern repeats across every field: the most successful people are voracious readers.

Why? Because in our rapidly evolving professional landscape, **continuous learning is non-negotiable**.

The skills that got you hired today will be obsolete in five years. Industries transform. Technologies emerge. Business models evolve. The only way to remain relevant is to keep learning, and reading remains the most efficient method for acquiring new knowledge and skills.

_Want to understand emerging technologies?_ **Read**.

_Want to master leadership?_ **Read**.

_Want to learn negotiation, marketing, psychology, finance, or any other professional skill?_ **Read**.

The ROI on reading is staggering. A R250 book can contain insights that took someone 20 years to learn, delivered to you in 6 hours of reading. It’s the ultimate leverage.

### 5. Mental Health and Stress Reduction

The 2020s brought us a global pandemic, economic uncertainty, political chaos, climate anxiety, and collective trauma.

Mental health has become a crisis within a crisis.

Burnout is endemic.

Anxiety and depression rates have skyrocketed.

_Reading for just 6 minutes can reduce stress levels by up to 68%:_ more effective than listening to music, drinking tea, or taking a walk, according to research from the University of Sussex. When you read, your heart rate slows, muscle tension eases, and stress hormones decrease.

But reading offers more than temporary escape. It provides frameworks for understanding your experiences, vocabulary for expressing your emotions, and proof that others have survived what you’re going through.

Reading about psychology helps you understand your own mind.

Reading about philosophy gives you tools for finding meaning.

Reading stories reminds you that struggle is universal and survivable.

In a world that feels increasingly chaotic and overwhelming, reading offers a rare combination: both sanctuary and strength. It’s both comfort and empowerment.

### 6. Building Digital Literacy and Content Discernment

The 2020s have made something abundantly clear: _not all content is created equal._

A 280-character tweet is not equivalent to a 2,000-word essay.

A TikTok video is not equivalent to a documentary.

A Facebook meme is not equivalent to investigative journalism.

People who read regularly particularly those who read books and long-form articles develop what I call “content literacy.”

They can distinguish between shallow and deep, between entertainment and education, between information and wisdom.

When you’ve experienced the richness of well-researched, carefully argued, beautifully written content, you become less satisfied with the intellectual equivalent of junk food. You start craving substance. You become a more discerning consumer of all media.

This skill is crucial because we’re all now content consumers 12+ hours a day. The question isn’t whether you’re consuming content, it’s whether you’re consuming content that enriches or diminishes you.

### 7. Expanding Creativity and Innovation

Here’s something that surprises people: _reading makes you more creative._ You’d think creativity comes from doing, not consuming. But here’s the paradox: creative breakthroughs almost always come from combining existing ideas in novel ways.

Steve Jobs famously said, “Creativity is just connecting things.” The more things you know, the more concepts, stories, frameworks, and ideas you’ve absorbed through reading, the more raw material your brain has to work with when making creative connections.

Reading across disciplines is particularly powerful. The breakthrough in your field might come from a concept you encountered in a completely unrelated book.

Biology informs architecture.

Philosophy informs technology.

History informs business strategy.

The most innovative thinkers are almost always interdisciplinary readers. They don’t just read in their field, they read promiscuously across every subject, collecting ideas like treasure, waiting for the right moment to connect them into something new.

### 8. Combating Loneliness and Building Connection

The 2020s brought us a loneliness epidemic that predated COVID-19 but was dramatically accelerated by it. We’re more “connected” than ever through technology, yet more isolated than previous generations.

Reading connects us across time and space to other human minds. When you read someone’s words, you’re literally inside their thoughts. You’re experiencing consciousness-to-consciousness communication. An author who died 200 years ago can speak directly to you today, sharing their wisdom, their fears, their insights, their humor.

Reading also creates community. Book clubs, online reading communities, literary festivals, and casual conversations that begin with “Have you read…?” all create genuine human connection around shared ideas and stories.

In a world where superficial digital interaction is making us lonelier, reading offers something profound: intimate access to other minds, both living and dead, and communities built around ideas rather than algorithms.

### 9. Developing Patience and Delayed Gratification

We live in an instant-everything culture. Food delivery in 20 minutes. Streaming any movie immediately. Shopping with same-day delivery. Dating that reduces humans to swipeable profiles. We’ve been trained to expect instant results and immediate satisfaction.

_Reading teaches patience._

A novel unfolds over hours or days.

An argument develops across chapters.

Character development happens gradually.

You can’t skip to the ending without ruining the experience.

You have to trust the process, surrender to the author’s pace, and accept that satisfaction will come through investment rather than immediacy.

This capacity for delayed gratification, which reading uniquely develops, is one of the strongest predictors of long-term success in life. The famous marshmallow test demonstrated this with children. The adults who succeed in careers, relationships, health, and finances are those who can delay gratification.

Reading is marshmallow-test training for your brain. Every book you finish despite wanting to check your phone is a victory for your future self.

### 10. Creating Identity and Purpose

Finally, and perhaps most profoundly, _reading shapes who you become._ You are, in many ways, the accumulated average of the ideas you’ve exposed yourself to. The books you read become part of your internal landscape, shaping your values, worldview, aspirations, and sense of what’s possible.

_Want to become more compassionate?_ **Read books that expand your empathy.**

_Want to become more ambitious?_ **Read biographies of people who achieved remarkable things.**

_Want to become wiser?_ **Read philosophy.**

_Want to understand yourself?_ **Read psychology.**

_Want to dream bigger?_ **Read science fiction.**

Your reading list becomes your curriculum for self-creation. Unlike formal education, which follows someone else’s syllabus, your personal reading allows you to design your own education, to become the person you want to be by consuming the ideas that will build that person.

In the 2020s, when traditional institutions, career paths, and social structures are all being disrupted, the ability to self-educate and self-reinvent is crucial. Reading gives you that power.

_So here’s my invitation to you, whether you’re a committed reader looking for affirmation, a lapsed reader hoping to rediscover the habit, or someone who’s never quite understood what all the fuss is about:_

### **Give reading a real chance.**

Not as a chore,
---------------

not as an obligation,

not as something you force yourself to do because it’s “good for you”,

but as an adventure,

as a refuge,

as a tool for becoming whoever you want to become.

Start with a sentence if you need to.

Ten pages a day.

One chapter before bed.

A single book this month.

Don’t compare yourself to people who read 100 books a year.

Don’t feel guilty about reading genres that others dismiss as “not serious.”

_Mystery novels, romance, science fiction, fantasy, graphic novels, young adult, it all counts._

**The best book is the one you’ll actually read.**

If you’re not sure where to start, here’s a secret: _the right book finds you when you need it._

Browse a bookstore or library without pressure.

Pick up books that call to you for reasons you can’t explain.

Read the first page. If it grabs you, keep going.

If it doesn’t, put it down without guilt and try another.

You don’t have to finish every book you start. This isn’t school. There are no tests, no book reports, no grades. Reading should be a pleasure, not a punishment.

_Permission granted:_ **_abandon books that don’t serve you._**

**The book that changes someone else’s life might bore you to tears.** _That’s fine._

Your book is out there, the one that will crack you open, shift your perspective, and make you understand why people become obsessed with reading.

### The 2030s

And Beyond…
-----------

I meant what I said in the introduction:

_I’ll probably write about reading again in the 2030s._

Not because I’m repetitive, but because this message matters enough to keep sharing across decades.

The technologies will change. Maybe we’ll be reading through brain-computer interfaces. Maybe AI will personalize books in real-time based on our responses. Maybe virtual reality will make us feel like we’re inside the stories we read.

But the fundamental magic, one human mind communing with ideas, stories, and knowledge, will remain constant. The transformation that happens when you consistently expose yourself to great thinking, beautiful writing, and powerful stories will endure regardless of the

_If you’ve read this far, and given the length of this article, I’m genuinely impressed and grateful that you have , you’ve already demonstrated something crucial: you have the capacity for sustained attention and deep reading._

**_You just proved it to yourself._**
