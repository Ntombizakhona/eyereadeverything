# EyeReadEverything

**EyeReadEverything** is more than just a blog or a project for **Ntombizakhona Mabaso**. It’s a personal journey of discovery and reflection,a carefully curated archive where I review and record everything I read.

This space is a gift to my future self: a growing collection of insights, lessons, emotions, and moments captured in words as I move from one page to the next.

## The Goal

I’ve set an ambitious reading goal:

- **250 books by 2025**

It’s a commitment to curiosity, literature, and continual learning—and a way to explore diverse worlds, ideas, and perspectives through books.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Book reviews and reflections (what I learned, what challenged me, what stayed with me)
- Notes and key takeaways worth remembering
- A record of my reading journey over time

I’m not trying to review books “perfectly.” I’m here to read deeply, think honestly, and document what each book leaves behind.

## Join the Journey

This isn’t meant to be a solitary challenge.

If you love reading,or want to read more,you’re warmly invited to join me. Read alongside me, share recommendations, and follow the journey as I work toward 250 books.

Your presence will only enrich this adventure.

## Why “EyeReadEverything”?

Because reading is how I pay attention—how I notice the world, question it, and understand it better. This is my way of tracking that growth, one book at a time.
