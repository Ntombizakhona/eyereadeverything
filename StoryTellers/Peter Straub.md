# R.I.P Peter Straub

## 02 March 1943–04 September 2022

I have just finished reading _Ghost Story_ by Peter Straub for the — I’ve, uh, lost count, sorry — nth time (equation coming soon) over the years.

He recently passed away on the 4th of September 2022 (a dreadful day indeed)at the age of 79, so I presume (hope) he lived a long and beautiful life.


I was relatively heartbroken because he was one of my favorite authors growing up.
I discovered him by accident.
By the time I was 11, I had read all the books in the Children’s and Teen section of my local library (The Newcastle Library) — encyclopedias and dictionaries included!

As a twelve-year-old, I couldn’t resist sneaking into the Adult Section. Their books were thicker, with smaller print, and seemed much longer, as compared to the three words per page, with unnecessarily large pictures books from the Children’s Section. The books in that section felt like a joke, as if teenagers and children didn’t deserve more words!

Since I had devoured countless Goosebumps books by R.L. Stine, I wandered around the Adult section until a ghost seemed to nudge me towards the Horror Section. I stumbled, a book fell on me, and there it was, in all its glory, beckoning me: _Ghost Story_ by Peter Straub.

We were destined to meet.
(Me and the book.
The true love of my life.
My soulmate.)
Poetic.

This book may have been the best introduction to the genres of horror, suspense, and weird fiction I could have had.
It’s the best book I’ve ever read in my life.
It left quite an impression on me.
And years later, every time I read it, it feels like the first time.

Rest in Peace, Peter Straub. Thank you for introducing me to the weird and creepy. I can’t wait to reread all your other books. You should definitely read _Ghost Story_ if you haven’t— it’s incredible!
