This is a great, educational book about the body, reproductive organs and how to have, sane, safe, consensual sex and how to talk about it with your partner or parents or just about anyone really (but partner mostly).

It really emphasizes the importance of safe, consensual sex.
It is definitely nothing like the Kama Sutra, it is absolutely a beginner’s guide for those who have not quite done “it” yet.
...Virgins and Virgin Adjacent People.
And if you believe you’re genophobic, this might be a good book to help with your aversion…

It is truly amazingly educational, really it is, I now know more about the female and male body, as it relates to issues like menstruation, menopause, aging, impotence, sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, unwanted pregnancies, different types of sexualities and the gender spectrum, amongst all others...who knew? Not me!

The human body is strange, predictably strange and sex makes it stranger, so this book will definitely help you deal with all the consequences and things you didn’t think about, and, it really feels like the author is in the room with you, teaching you the things that need to be done.

It is the type of book you should read if you somehow caught yourself Googling something along the lines of
“What is sex?”
“How to have sex?”
“How did the mayonnaise get inside the sausage?"
And it will definitely answer your questions.

Great for the inexperienced, the self-conscious Late Bloomers who have been thinking about sex, because experienced fornicators might be disappointed, (once again) its not the Kama Sutra, it’s literal sex education.
It’s awesome for people who are curious about sex and its consequences, and want to be educated thoroughly, or at least touch some base.
And if you want to educate yourself about the other gender, you should read it as well.
