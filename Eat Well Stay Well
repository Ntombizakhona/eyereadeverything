Eat Well Stay Well

I read a, uh… a cookbook?
Indeed!
But, hear me out…
…this book has taught me that it is actually never too late to find pleasure in something that you didn’t even realise you were doing wrong this entire time, like woah, it can be this GOOD: unreal.
I thought I hated cooking, but it turns out, it’s actually quite fun if you don’t treat it like a chore and you have access to awesome recipes.

Eat Well, Stay Well is more than just a cook book, it has information about antioxidants, nutrients, vitamins, minerals and nourishing ailments that help with common illnesses.

We need to heal ourselves through food, because quality medical care has become rather quite comically expensive and downright inaccessible these days.
The recipes in there are awesome as they include healing, healthy foods that are definitely in your house, if not, you will certainly find them at your nearest store.
The recipes will actually help you make aesthetically pleasing foods, which will make you want to eat the food you make!

As someone who has often avoided the kitchen, this book has given me the desire to cook and I am now in love with pots, pans, and spoons, and forks, yeah!
It is really great for people who have never been a boffin in the kitchen, and it is great in educating those with the hearts of chefs to make food that is throughly nutritious!It even teaches you how to chop tomatoes, caramelise onions, steaming… the techniques in there are plenty and magnificent!

Health is indeed Wealth.
You need this in your kitchen, I highly recommend it.
What a beautiful book, I keep glancing at it.
I think I’m in Love.
