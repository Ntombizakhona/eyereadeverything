# Stop Procrastinating

## Kill the “Start Tomorrow” Demon
-------------------------------

**Stop Procrastinating!**

Oh, when you want to start working on your goals or venture into something new, there is a demon lurking in the background, taunting you.

_Start tomorrow. Start tomorrow._ It chants.

Then, you settle back into your comfortable chair, you probably sink into your bed, grab the remote, click on your favorite channel, and let it play in the background.

You reach for your phone, order some food, switch between apps, and scroll through social media.

Then you alternate to a messaging app, view your friends’ stories, and laugh here and there, or you stare at them coldly like a psychopath.

Your food arrives, you collect it.

Phone in one hand, the other hand is busy transporting food into your mouth, you don’t even enjoy the taste because you’re distracted. Noise is blasting from your TV or laptop.

You watch your series late into the night and wake up long after the sun has risen, and whisper, “I’ll start tomorrow.”

Tomorrow becomes tomorrow, which becomes tomorrow again, and before you know it, years have passed.

You’ve become another gluttonous sloth, a couch potato living day-to-day with limited ambitions and goals. Consuming never creating.

Your ideas and dreams, unacted upon and unexecuted, remain in Tomorrowland, never manifesting today, the present moment.

The _Start Tomorrow_ Demon has won.

It’s time to **kill** that procrastination demon and start actualizing your ideas instead of idealizing them.

> I don’t know where to start.
> 
> You do; the problem is that you think you need an entire plan before starting.
> 
> People need to stop expecting to see a clear path through to the end before they even begin.
> 
> – Patrick King

Procrastination often happens because people view the task ahead as a mountain that must be conquered in one go, or an elephant to be consumed like a rotisserie chicken.

But it’s been well-researched, and often emphasized, that starting small is the key.

Even though you must start, you haven’t.

Why?

Because you need to stop something first, no don’t stop it, kill it!

And what is that something? Procrastination: the _Start Tomorrow_ demon.

You have to kill that demon.

Apparently, we procrastinate due to fear, not excitement.

We fixate on the process of starting, instead of envisioning the end result.

So, stop being scared, and focus on the future.

Stop procrastinating.
