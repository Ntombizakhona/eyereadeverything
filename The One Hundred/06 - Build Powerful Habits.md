## Break Bad Habits

Habits. Habits. Habits.

The cornerstone of self-development — or the ruination of your life.

Can you honestly get anything done without consistent, positive habits?

I get it. You’ve heard it all before. Every article, book, or course out there in almost any field loves to hammer home the importance of good habits. So, here I am, adding to the mountain of advice on the necessity of positive habits, and here’s why:

> _We are what we repeatedly do._ — Aristotle

Aristotle’s words capture a profound truth: our daily actions define us. Habits, whether constructive or destructive, accumulate into the essence of our lives. They shape our character, influence our productivity, and determine the trajectory of our goals. The beauty of habits lies in their consistency, a single, small action repeated daily can create monumental change over time.

Understanding How Habits Work
-----------------------------

In _The Power of Habit_, Charles Duhigg explains habits using the “habit loop,” which consists of three elements:

1.  **Cue**: A trigger that initiates the habit.
2.  **Routine**: The behavior or action performed.
3.  **Reward**: The benefit that reinforces the habit.

For example, if you feel stressed **(cue)**, you might eat greasy fries **(routine)** to feel comforted **(reward)**. Over time, this loop becomes automatic, and all of a sudden you’re obese, and you don’t know how it happened. _But you do know._ Habits can be difficult to break, but they’re also powerful tools for transformation.

Why Habits Matter
-----------------

Habits streamline decision-making and free up mental energy for bigger tasks. They also have a cumulative effect: good habits compound into success, while bad habits lead to setbacks.

> As James Clear writes in _Atomic Habits_:
> _“You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems.”_

Your habits are your systems.

Daily routines like exercising, journaling, reading, or eating healthy meals create stability in an unpredictable world. They provide structure, foster self-discipline, and build momentum, making large goals feel achievable.

A Personal Habit Journey
------------------------

Once upon a time, I wrote a lot. As a child, I’d churn out stories of fifty thousand words in a day (don’t ask me how, I had no responsibilities). But then life happened. Responsibilities piled up, and writing fell to the wayside. Still, the love for writing nagged at me, so I decided to start small, something as simple as journaling.

At first, I struggled. I ambitiously told myself I’d journal for an hour every day, imagining profound epiphanies pouring onto the page. Unsurprisingly, that didn’t happen. Life intervened. Eventually, I scaled back to just five minutes a day after being inspired by W. Somerset Maugham’s cheeky wisdom:’

> _“I only write when inspiration strikes; fortunately, it strikes every morning at nine o’clock sharp.” — W. Somerset Maugham_

That small shift changed everything. Five minutes became ten, then twenty. Within months, journaling was a non-negotiable part of my daily routine. It didn’t just help me process emotions, it improved my writing and sharpened my focus, because writing can be rather quite tedious, you need to develop a habit for it.

Building Keystone Habits
------------------------

Duhigg highlights the concept of _keystone habits_: habits that spark positive changes in other areas of life. Examples include:

### **Exercise**

Exercise improves mood, sleep, and even dietary choices. Once you start exercising you just start craving better foods, your prioritize sleep, and you feel better overall.

### **Journaling**

Journaling enhances self-awareness and emotional intelligence, because it gives you the time to self-reflect. This not only helps you, but you become a more tolerable human being when you realize how your behaviour impacts others.

### **Morning routines**

Starting the day with intention often leads to greater productivity. You should develop a morning routine that is aligned with your passion and your profession. I like writing, so I need to start my day by reading.

Start small. Instead of committing to a thirty minute workout, try a five-minute walk. Replace _“I’ll write a book this year”_ with _“I’ll write one page today.”_ And sip tea while reading a chapter every morning, you’ll naturally read faster and accomplish more over time.

Breaking Bad Habits
-------------------

Bad habits are stubborn but not unchangeable. Start by identifying the cues and rewards behind them.

For instance, if stress drives you to snack on junk food, replace the snack with a quick stretch or a glass of water. Your brain will eventually associate the cue with this healthier reward, and voilà, a new habit forms.

If you know you’re doing something that you shouldn’t be doing, just find an alternative. A better, positive alternative. Simple.

Habits aren’t just actions; they’re reflections of our priorities. By consciously choosing routines that align with your values, you create a life of purpose and fulfillment. And you won’t obsesses with what others are doing, because you’ll be focused on yourself.

Book Recommendation
-------------------

For a deeper dive into the science of habits, pick up _The Power of Habit_ by Charles Duhigg. With engaging storytelling (he is a good storyteller, if I may say so myself) and practical insights, Duhigg unpacks how habits form, influence our lives, and can be changed for the better.
