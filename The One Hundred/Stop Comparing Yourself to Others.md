# Stop Comparing Yourself to Others

Focus on Your Own Journey
-------------------------

Comparison is a trap, and, let’s face it, one of the hardest habits to break. You scroll through Instagram, see someone’s tropical vacation, dream wedding, or perfect avocado slices, and suddenly, your own life feels dull in comparison, because how do they even slice an avocado like that, mine is always hard or on the brink of death.

Theodore Roosevelt **warned** us:

> Comparison is the thief of joy.

And he wasn’t wrong. Constantly measuring your progress against someone else’s can leave you feeling inadequate and drained. But the truth is, their path is not your path. It’s time to stop looking over the fence and start watering your own grass.

Why Do We Compare Ourselves?
----------------------------

Two words: _Human Nature._ Human beings are wired to compare. From an evolutionary perspective, it was a survival mechanism. Knowing where you stood in your tribe helped you navigate threats and opportunities. But in today’s hyper-connected world, this instinct has turned toxic.

Mark Manson, in his bright orange book, _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fck*_, explains that much of our dissatisfaction comes from focusing on external metrics of success rather than internal values. He writes:

> The desire for more positive experience is itself a negative experience. And, paradoxically, the acceptance of one’s negative experience is itself a positive experience.

_In other words, chasing after what others have often leads to unhappiness. The solution? Focus on what truly matters to you._

The Comparison Trap
-------------------

Social media is one of the biggest culprits of comparison. Highlight reels masquerade as reality, and it’s easy to forget that people only show what they want you to see. No one posts about their messy kitchen after attempting to slice a messy avocado, late-night existential crises, or failed job interviews.

When we compare ourselves to these curated lives, we set ourselves up for disappointment. But remember:

1.  Their success doesn’t diminish yours.
2.  Their journey isn’t yours to replicate.
3.  Don’t get jealous, be inspired.

_Instead of comparing, celebrate their wins as proof that success is possible for everyone, including you._

How to Break Free from Comparison
---------------------------------

### Define Your Own Metrics of Success

Manson emphasizes the importance of choosing values that align with your authentic self. Ask yourself:

**What matters to me?**

Is it wealth?

Relationships?

Creativity?

Or peace of mind?

_By focusing on your unique goals and values, you’ll stop feeling the need to measure up to someone else’s._

### Limit Your Social Media Exposure

The less time you spend scrolling through others’ lives, the more time you have to focus on your own:

1.  Take regular social media breaks, or even better, I don’t recall where I first read this but, **_only login when you have something to post, and then post before you scroll._**
2.  Follow accounts that inspire you, not ones that make you feel inferior.
3.  Remind yourself that social media is not real life, I mean it is real life, but most of us choose to share our bestest moments, cutest outfits, and the steering wheel of our most expensive car, usually.

### Practice Gratitude

Gratitude shifts your focus from what you lack to what you have. Every day, write down three things you’re grateful for. Over time, this practice can train your brain to find joy in the present moment. **Don’t be jealous of others, be inspired.**

### Compete Only with Yourself

Your contender? The Person in the Mirror. Instead of trying to outdo others, strive to be better than you were yesterday. Small improvements add up over time and lead to genuine progress.

I used to constantly compare my writing to that of famous authors. I’d read a beautifully crafted sentence and think, “I’ll never write like that.” It was discouraging, to say the least. But then I realized: I’m not supposed to write like them – I’m supposed to write like me. And so I did.

The Freedom of Not Giving a F*ck
---------------------------------

Mark Manson’s book is a breath of fresh air in the world of self-development, well, mainly the title to be quite honest. He argues that freedom comes from caring deeply about the right things and letting go of everything else.

Moving Forward
--------------

Comparison may be natural, but it doesn’t have to control you. By focusing on your own journey and embracing your unique path, you can find joy and fulfillment where you are, not where you think you should be.

The next time you catch yourself scrolling and comparing, pause and ask:

### What do I value most?

### Am I working toward those values?

### What small step can I take today to move closer to my goals?

Book Recommendation
-------------------

For a no-nonsense guide to breaking free from comparison and finding your own path, I highly recommend _The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck_ by Mark Manson. It’s literally bright orange, you can’t miss it at the book store, and it’s always there. It’s a bestseller.
