# The One Hundred

## Building Resilience
-------------------

You’ve probably heard of Malcolm Gladwell’s 10,000-hour rule, which suggests that to become highly skilled at something, you need to spend around 10,000 hours practicing it. That’s approximately 419 days or 2 years, without factoring in sleep, exercise, relationships, and eating. This could mean that the actual time it takes to reach 10,000 hours might be closer to 5 years. That sounds like a lot, doesn’t it?

While I haven’t read Gladwell’s book “Outliers” (it’s on my to-read list, I promise!), although I’ve heard that the 10,000-hour rule is an oversimplification of existing research. Regardless, it’s clear that putting in the hours is essential. But let’s move on and set the 10,000 hours aside for now.

### The One Hundred

Have you heard of “The One Hundred”? I can’t quite recall where I came across it, but it’s not related to the TV series “The 100” (which I need to rewatch, as it teaches you about love, resilience and perseverance).

**The One Hundred** refers to a discipline and motivation technique that involves doing something 100 times before analyzing your work or giving up. The number 100 is significant because if you only do something 18 times, you’ll know you’ve failed (18% of 100). So, 100 attempts provide a good benchmark to gauge your commitment and identify areas for improvement if you fail.

Attempting to do something 100 times can have numerous benefits, including:

**Mastery:** Repeating a task 100 times can help you master it, making you more efficient and proficient.

**Muscle Memory**: Your body develops muscle memory, allowing you to perform the task without conscious thought.

**Improved Skills**: The more you practice, the better you become at the skill or task.

**Confidence Boost:** Achieving a goal like doing something 100 times can give you a sense of accomplishment and confidence.

**Habit formation:** Repeating a task 100 times can help create a habit, making it easier to continue performing the task.

**Improved focus:** You develop greater focus and concentration by dedicating time to a single task.

**Efficiency:** You learn to complete the task more quickly and efficiently.

**Better Understanding:** Repeated practice helps you understand the task or skill more deeply.

**Build Resilience:** Overcoming the challenge of doing something 100 times can help build resilience and perseverance.

**Sense of Pride:** Achieving this milestone can give you a sense of pride and satisfaction.

### Failing The One Hundred

Whatever the reason may be, attempting to do your favorite thing 100 times and failing might help you pinpoint exactly where you’re lacking, enabling you to identify what you need to work on to achieve your goals

If you don’t commit or come short, you’ll have a clear understanding of why you failed. The reason might be related to your personality, income, environment, or support system, amongst various factors that you’ll identify and rectify.

### Passing The One Hundred

If you stick to The Hundred, you’ll not only develop resilience but also have 100 iterations of that particular thing to analyze, make deductions from, and use to develop a new strategy for improvement.

Now, isn’t that lovely?

### My One Hundred Posts

With my next 100 posts, I hope to write more and apply the knowledge I’ve acquired from reading extensively. I aim to motivate myself (and hopefully you too) to read more, write more, journal, strengthen relationships, eat healthier, learn new things, exercise regularly, and lead a more purposeful and peaceful lifestyle.

Let’s get started! And to get started, we need to… well, start!
