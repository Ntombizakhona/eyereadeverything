# Start Now

### Just Begin Already

The beginning of anything starts with a ***drumroll***…_beginning._

Anyways, when in doubt, I am continuously inspired and motivated by the wise words of Ijeoma Umebinyuo:

> “Start now.
> Start where you are.
> Start with fear.
> Start with pain.
> Start with doubt.
> Start with hands shaking.
> Start with voice trembling, but start.
> Start and don’t stop.
> Start where you are, with what you have.
> Just… start.”

These words encourage me to wake up in the morning, make my bed, drink water, and get ready to start the day, regardless of how yesterday went, because every day presents a new opportunity to begin.
To _start._
To start over.
To start again.

They inspire me to be fearless in my pursuits and just get started, because everything else will follow. All you need to do is start.

### **START DOING NOW**

> Stop researching, stop agonizing, stop wasting time, and start doing. Do what you can right now, and you can figure out the next steps after. You probably already know your next steps, however small they may be.
> — Patrick King

Reading numerous self-help books and articles, particularly in the domains of personal development, building self-discipline, and cultivating positive habits, has taught me that you need messages about starting and developing positive habits constantly and continuously drilled into your head to counteract the unrelentingly persistent messages around us influenced by mainstream media, advertisers, and, most importantly, your own laziness and procrastination.

Although reading is great and a positive habit in and of itself, you must become a practitioner when it comes to developing self-discipline and building resilience. Therefore, don’t just consume theoretical advice for who knows how long: remember to take action. _Start Doing_ **Now**_._

### **START EXERCISING NOW**

How often do you see ads and commentary about quick fixes for a fit and healthy body — from crash diets to surgery and now Ozempic? These things usually offer unsatisfactory, expensive, and temporary results. At the end of the day, you will have to put in the work by getting up and working out!

You can start with a walk, then a jog. But you have to do the work. You have to get up and move. _Start Exercising_ **Now_._**

### **START EATING HEALTHY NOW**

How often do you see an ad for fast food or delivery apps? Quite often, right? They’re inescapable.
And how often do you see ads about fruits, vegetables… exactly.

I just jogged past numerous large billboards with burgers and fries enticing me to purchase them, which means you need to go out of your way to consume healthy food.

If you’ve been addicted to scrolling through fast food delivery apps or driving through for boxed meals…
Well, it’s time to delete those apps, hide your car keys and start working on a diet that prioritizes nutritious, home-cooked meals, that cater to _your health needs,_ as opposed to consuming prepared meals for a general, generic public.
_Start Eating Healthy_ **Now.**

### **START PRIORITIZING MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIPS NOW**

How often do we see articles and shows that glamorize toxic relationships? It’s the core of entertainment. People love gossiping about who is cheating on whom and engaging in endless gender wars. Redundant relationship drama happens almost every second on social media, you don’t have to contribute.

And how often do you see healthy relationships being praised? Not enough.
Which means you have to go out of your way to find representations of healthy families, friendships, and romantic relationships.

If you know more about someone else’s relationship drama while neglecting your own, it’s time to prioritize your people.

### **START PURCHASING MINDFULLY NOW**

How often do you see ads encouraging you to blindly consume material you don’t need instead of purchasing things you actually desire?
Oh look, to your left — another product claiming to give you glowing skin! To your right — lose weight in 21 days with THIS!

Start shopping for essentials you need, and for wants that truly complement your lifestyle. Avoid mindlessly purchasing things you’ll soon forget, driven by hype and trends. Save for the future.
_Start Purchasing Mindfully_ **Now.**

### **START A HOBBY NOW**

To consume less unnecessary media, it’s good to have a hobby that helps you pass time. If you’re in the creative sphere, perhaps you can become a technical hobbyist — learn a programming language, machine learning, or cloud computing.

Or maybe you’re a technical, STEM-focused person — why not learn to draw, sketch, or venture into creative writing?
Hobbies will keep you from doom scrolling and may even lead to more mindful purchases. Most importantly, hobbies can help you build a community and foster healthy relationships around them.

Well, what are you waiting for?
_Start A Hobby_ **Now.**

### **LET ME START ENDING THIS POST NOW**

We are bombarded by media that focuses on instant gratification, leading us to make choices we later regret. Hmm, I guess advertising is so expensive and ads are somewhat omnipresent because they’re designed to convince us to focus on external matters instead of looking inward and focusing on ourselves.

We mindlessly consume junk food, engage in toxic relationships, buy unnecessary things for an audience that won’t even be at our funerals, and waste time gossiping. Meanwhile, we neglect hobbies and activities that could stimulate us mentally, creatively, or physically.

Well, today looks like a good time to start a healthy diet, build positive relationships, purchase essentials like we did during lockdown, and find hobbies that nurture both ourselves and others.

### **BOOK RECOMMENDATION**

Looking for a book on getting started and beating procrastination or whatever it is that is making you hesitate to start what you need to start? Well, you can peruse _The Science of Getting Started_ by Patrick King.
