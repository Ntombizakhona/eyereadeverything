# Put In The Effort


Persist While Others Quit
-------------------------


> “Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.” – Neale Donald Walsch

The comfort zone is cozy. It’s where we binge-watch shows, avoid risks, and stick to what we know. But Angela Duckworth’s Grit makes one thing clear: nothing worthwhile grows there. Success, fulfillment, and resilience are born when we embrace discomfort and push past our limits.

At the heart of her message is a simple truth: Talent is not enough. While natural ability might get you in the door, it’s **grit** – _passion and perseverance_ – that keeps you going when things get tough. As Duckworth puts it:

> Our potential is one thing. What we do with it is quite another. – Angela Duckworth

Talent Is Overrated
-------------------

In Chapter 2, _Distracted by Talent_, Duckworth dismantles the myth that success is primarily about innate ability. We often idolize talent, assuming that greatness comes easily to the gifted. But as Duckworth argues, this mindset underestimates the power of effort.

> But another conclusion is that the focus on talent distracts us from something that is at least as important, and that is effort. – Angela Duckworth

Talent without consistent effort is wasted. The real heroes of success are those who persist when others quit. Duckworth shares stories of Olympic athletes, entrepreneurs, and artists who succeeded not because they were the most gifted, but because they worked harder and longer than anyone else.

### Passion + Perseverance

The Grit Formula
----------------

Duckworth introduces her “grit formula” in _Chapter 3,_ Effort Counts Twice. This equation explains why effort is the great equalizer.

> Skill = Talent × Effort
> 
> Achievement = Skill × Effort

Effort appears twice because it turns potential into skills, and skills into achievements. Without effort, even the most talented individuals plateau.

> Talent is how quickly your skills improve when you invest effort.
> 
> Achievement is what happens when you take your acquired skills and use them. – Angela Duckworth

The Culture of Grit
-------------------

In _Chapter 12,_ **The Culture of Grit**, Duckworth explores how our environment shapes our perseverance. Being surrounded by gritty people – whether in families, schools, workplaces, or communities can significantly influence our own grit.

Culture creates expectations. When you’re immersed in an environment that values hard work, perseverance, and resilience, you’re more likely to adopt those values.

Duckworth gives examples from military academies, sports teams, and even startups where grit is part of the organizational DNA. At West Point, for instance, cadets face the grueling “Beast Barracks.” While individual grit matters, it’s the collective culture that helps them push through. Seeing their peers persist inspires them to do the same.

For those of us outside military academies, the takeaway is simple: surround yourself with people who challenge you to grow. Join communities that inspire resilience, whether it’s a book club, fitness group, or professional network.

### The Engine of Growth

Deliberate Practice
-------------------

Growth requires discomfort, and that’s the essence of _Chapter 5,_ **Grit Grows**. Duckworth explains that deliberate practice – focused, effortful improvement – is what separates high achievers from the rest, when growing grit.

> First comes interest. Passion begins with intrinsically enjoying what you do. – Angela Duckworth

Unlike casual repetition, deliberate practice is targeted. It involves identifying weaknesses, seeking feedback, and pushing yourself just beyond your comfort zone. Olympic swimmer Rowdy Gaines didn’t simply swim laps for fun – he trained with relentless focus on improving his weakest strokes.

> Next comes the capacity to practice. One form of perseverance is the daily discipline of trying to do things better than we did yesterday.
> 
> Third is purpose. What ripens passion is the conviction that your work matters. For most people, interest without purpose is nearly impossible to sustain for a lifetime.
> 
> And, finally, hope. Hope is a rising-to-the-occasion kind of perseverance. – Angela Duckworth

Building Grit in Your Life
--------------------------

Here are some actionable steps to step out of your comfort zone and cultivate grit:

### Set Stretch Goals

Create goals that push you slightly beyond your current abilities. Growth happens at the edge of your comfort zone.

### Practice Deliberately

Focus on improving specific areas where you struggle, seek feedback, and repeat.

### Surround Yourself with Gritty People

Join communities that value perseverance. The culture of grit is contagious, so find a network that inspires you.

### Celebrate Effort, Not Just Results

Duckworth emphasizes the importance of rewarding hard work. Success is a byproduct of effort, so value the process over the outcome.

> Let me close with a few final thoughts. The first is that you can grow your grit.
> 
> I see two ways to do so. On your own, you can grow your grit “from the inside out”: You can cultivate your interests. You can develop a habit of daily challenge-exceeding-skill practice. You can connect your work to a purpose beyond yourself. And you can learn to hope when all seems lost.
> 
> You can also grow your grit “from the outside in.” Parents, coaches, teachers, bosses, mentors, friends – developing your personal grit depends critically on other people. – Angela Duckworth

If you surround yourself with a culture of grit, embrace deliberate practice, and persist through challenges, you’ll discover that success isn’t about talent – it’s about effort. Duckworth’s work reminds us that while talent opens the door, grit takes you all the way.
