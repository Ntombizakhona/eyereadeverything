# 365 Days With Self-Discipline 
## 365 Life-Altering Thoughts on Self-Control, Mental Resilience, and Success
**by**
*Martin Meadows*

You can read a 'Day' or chapter per day.

You don't necessarily have to read it all in a day as it is quite repetitive, and redundant, you might get annoyed. You really should spread it out over a few days or weeks or even months. A ‘day’ a day is enough to be quite honest.

It basically tries to drill the message of self-discipline, delayed gratification, routine, health prioritisation and financial management into you.

It doesn't really feel like reading, it feels like you're having a conversation with a mentor, who answers the questions you probably already have the answers to, but you need them constantly and continuously redrilled into your very stubborn head, once again, the book is extremely repetitive.

If you’re in a mood to be told what you know you have to do, well, this is the book for you! (less)
