# Atomic Habits
## An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones
**by** 
*James Clear* 

The title is pretty self-explanatory.
Even the author starts his book this way:

"atomic:
1. an extremely small amount of a thing; the single irreducible unit of a larger system.
2. the source of immense energy or power
habit:
1. a routine or practice performed regularly; an automatic response to a specific situation"

Atomic Habits, is a really great step by step guide on how to atomize your habits, because most people believe that they will achieve something great all at once, but such is not the case.
This book highlights, and emphasizes the importance of little habits, little changes, starting small…etc, it even has tables, graphs and diagrams (systems) that will help you, so you should definitely read it.
