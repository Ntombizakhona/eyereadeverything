# HTML5 
## 20 Lessons to Successful Web Development
**by**
*Robin Nixon*
...As I Quote The Book:

> "Each chapter is laid out as a lesson in a straightforward and logical manner, with plenty of examples written using simple and clear HTML.
> Before moving on to each subsequent
lesson, you have the opportunity to test your new knowledge with a set of 10 questions
about what you have just learned.

> You can also work along with every lesson by watching its accompanying video tutorial.

> Even if you don’t already know the previous version of HTML (version 4.1), you will
still learn quickly, because the first part of the book contains a comprehensive primer—
great for beginners, or useful for revising before moving on to the new features.”

...And:

> "This book covers every aspect of HTML and HTML5, starting with how to lay out an HTML document; handling fonts, colors, and images; creating lists and tables; and building forms.
> Then, after teaching some elementary JavaScript, it explains how to use the HTML5 canvas as a drawing tool, shows how you can access a user’s geolocation information, presents the latest
updates to web forms, reveals how to make use of local storage on the user’s device and,
after illustrating how easy it now is to add audio and video to your pages, also details how
to make offline web apps, and run background JavaScript tasks."
