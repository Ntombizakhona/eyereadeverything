# HTML and CSS
## Design and Build Websites
**by** 
*Jon Duckett*

This book is picturesque, modern & beautiful.
It is practical and easy to understand.
I recommend it to everyone who wants to begin their web development journey, or refresh their HTML & CSS.
It even touches on Search Engine Optimization and Analytics.
